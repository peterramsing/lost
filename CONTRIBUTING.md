## LostGrid Contributing Guide

First off, thanks for wanting to help!

To help keep LostGrid an organized codebase we use ESLint to organize the code. This will be added to the build process in coming versions. Until then please abide by the current ESLint configuration. You can test this by running `npm run lint` in your codebase before committing.

Thanks, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
